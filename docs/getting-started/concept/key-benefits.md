title: Key Benefits of EventStoreDB
---

# 1. Complete Audit Log and Deep Historical Insights

Unlike traditional databases that store only the current state of data, such as the current balance of a digital wallet, with EventStoreDB, you record every state change as an event—like each deposit and withdrawal. This allows you to track the complete history of entities and business processes over time.

By storing events this way, you can gain deep historical and behavioral insights into how different users and applications interact. This makes it easier to detect patterns (e.g. fraud detection based on transaction history) that are often difficult to spot using traditional databases.

Additionally, having access to a complete historical record of events enables you to build more accurate and nuanced predictive models. This enhances the effectiveness of your AI and machine learning efforts by uncovering patterns and trends that limited data might miss.

Use Case

A German tool manufacturer leveraged historical events from EventStoreDB on manufacturing times and tool specifications (such as length and diameter) to [predict manufacturing durations for custom tools](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/from-data-to-insights-using-event-log-data-to-train-machine-learning-models). This prediction was then integrated into an online quote system, generating instant quotes—a significant improvement over the previous method of manual quotes based on the sales team's experience.

# 2. Real-time Updates and Analysis

In contrast to traditional databases, where you typically synchronize changes from one application to other applications with delayed or scheduled batch processing, EventStoreDB enables you to handle both batch processing and real-time updates. 

With real-time delivery, events are instantly pushed, published, or streamed to your other applications as soon as they are captured. This is similar to push notifications sent to your mobile phone when your food delivery arrives at your doorstep.

This enables immediate responses to changes, facilitating quick analysis and action. As a result, you can make faster, more informed decisions and improve the customer experience by providing timely recommendations, alerts, and notifications.

Use Case

You can use EventStoreDB to streamline your payment process, just like Holcim, a global construction material provider, did. By [replacing batch processing with real-time streaming of payment statuses](https://www.eventstore.com/case-studies/holcim) from SAP system to depots, Holcim eliminated the previous day-long wait for payment verification and order collection. This significant improvement in customer service and operational efficiency can give you a competitive edge in your industry.

# 3. Decouple and Scale Legacy Systems

Compared to traditional databases, events can be an effective way to decouple dependencies, allowing your systems to communicate without being tightly tied to a specific database or application.

This approach allows you to break down overly interdependent software systems, components, and code bases. As a result, they become easier to scale, evolve, and update. Your business can then reduce technical debt, adapt more quickly to new market opportunities, and modernize legacy workflows with greater flexibility.

Use Case

Insureon, an independent marketplace for online delivery of small business insurance, used EventStoreDB to [modernize its legacy monolithic system](https://www.eventstore.com/case-studies/insureon), which was brittle and challenging to deploy. With EventStoreDB, Insureon could provide new solutions faster without sacrificing scalability. This dramatically improved the company's business creativity and agility.
