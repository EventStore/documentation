#  Characteristics of Business Processes that Fit EventStoreDB

EventStoreDB is well-suited to manage and track a wide range of business processes, from simple to sophisticated. While it's designed to handle processes that exhibit all the characteristics below, EventStoreDB is an excellent fit if your business processes demonstrate one or more of these traits.

| Characteristics of Business Process | What these Processes are | Why EventStoreDB Fits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auditable and traceable | Processes where every action or change you make is recorded and can be reviewed later, such as financial transactions or compliance checks. For example, you might track all customer interactions in a support system or monitor every step in a food processing plant. | EventStoreDB captures every change in its immutable event log, providing a full, reliable history, and you can organize events into one of its fine grained streams to support quick event retrieval for analysis. You can also add causation and correlation IDs to events to track the cause and effect of those events. |
| Distributed and interdependent with multiple systems | Processes where multiple systems, applications, or components rely on one another to complete tasks or functions, requiring coordinated communication and updates. These processes often face challenges like delays, errors, and difficulties to evolve due to problems with dependent systems. | EventStoreDB records every change as events so that you can to communicate asynchronously with other applications using EventStoreDB’s connector and subscription subsystem. This is a great way to decouple systems, allowing different parts of your business to scale and evolve independently, while still maintaining seamless communication and coordination between processes. |
| Reactive to change (Real-time) | Processes that immediately respond to new data or events as they happen, such as updating your account balance right after a transaction, or triggering an alert in your fraud detection system. | Every event captured by EventStoreDB can be delivered to you or your consumer in real-time or on-demand through its connectors or subscription subsystem. This allows you to instantly stream and track events, while also providing a complete historical record for deeper analysis if you need to replay events. |
| Support variety of flexible use cases | Processes that possess a variety of basic, alternative, and exceptional flows allow your business to flexibly adapt to customer needs and concerns. For example, an ordering system that supports returns, exchanges, pre-ordering, cross-border ordering, gift cards, and store credits. | EventStoreDB’s immutable event log  allows you to maintain full visibility into every step of the process, making troubleshooting and debugging easier. Events and asynchronous communication ~~and~~ allow you to design highly flexible use cases as you can notify variety of applications and users to handle exceptional use cases as they occur, without introducing excessive dependencies. Streams allows you to quickly access events you need for a specific entity or process. |
| Long running | Activities that take an extended period to complete often require multiple steps and interactions over time, involving several people. For instance, you might experience this with the ordering process, from placing the order to receiving the delivery, or during contract negotiations, where actions can stretch over hours, days, or even weeks. | With EventStoreDB’s durable event log, which persists all events indefinitely, you can easily track long-running business processes. Its sequential and globally ordered structure simplifies the process of reconciling events across different applications over time, allowing you to manage eventually consistent operations more efficiently and enhancing your overall development experience. |
| Order-Sensitive | Order-sensitive (or non-commutative) business processes are workflows where you must follow tasks in a specific sequence to ensure successful execution. For example, in fraud detection, a particular order of actions across different accounts triggers an alert. Similarly, when generating a global sales report, you need to consolidate data from multiple sources and a sales number conversion to USD depends on when foreign exchange rate is updated in the system. | With EventStoreDB’s globally consistent event log, you can aggregate events from multiple data sources, making it the de facto source of truth for their ordering when they were not ordered in the first place. This simplifies implementing order-sensitive operations, even when clocks between your applications aren’t synchronized. |
| Automatable | Repetitive, rule-based tasks that ~~can~~ you can perform with minimal human intervention using software. Examples include invoice processing, customer onboarding, and inventory management. A common challenge is ensuring your data is consistent and visible across systems due to complex workflows and distributed operations | EventStoreDB’s connector and subscription subsystems allow you to stream or publish events to other applications, helping you automate cross-application business processes. By using an event log, you ensure resilience, as checkpoints save the last completed actions. This means if a service fails, it can return to a previously known state rather than starting over from scratch. |
| Adaptable to Evolving Requirements | Processes designed to change and grow as business requirements, needs, regulations, or market conditions shift. For example, an e-commerce platform may need to modify its inventory management process to handle new trends in product availability or shipping delays, or a financial service provider might have to adjust its loan approval process to meet new compliance requirements | In EventStoreDB, events are immutable facts that you don’t need to change. Even when your requirements evolve, you can replay old events to regenerate read models that meet new criteria. Additionally, with EventStoreDB, your applications can be more loosely coupled, allowing you to break down large monolithic systems into smaller, independent services. This reduces your upgrade footprint, as only a few services may need updates, lowering the overall risk compared to upgrading an entire monolith. |
| Compliant with rules, constraints, and regulations | Processes within your organization that follow operational, industry standards, or legal requirements to ensure smooth operations. For example, your financial transactions adhere to banking regulations, and your employee payroll systems comply with labor laws, tax regulations, and your company’s policies on wages and benefits. | Your event log in EventStoreDB provides a complete and immutable history of changes in your application or auditing requirements. By using optimistic concurrency controls, you can ensure transactional consistency when needed. Additionally, the sequencing and ordering guarantees of events enable you to implement eventually consistent operations with ease. |
| Consistent | Processes with data that you need to keep synchronized across systems, applications, or databases while adhering to business rules and constraints. This ensures that your data remains trustworthy and meaningful for various reports and analysis. | EventStoreDB's event log can act as your application transaction log and historical source of truth, allowing you to reliably synchronize downstream applications eventually, even when different parts of your system are not up to date due to delays or downtime. With EventStoreDB's optimistic concurrency control, you can ensure that any rules requiring immediate consistency are enforced without locking or performance penalties. |
| Performant | Processes that operate efficiently and can handle high demands with minimal delays. For example, you might manage real-time financial transactions, oversee order processing systems, or handle inventory management for a large number of users. | EventStoreDB’s append-only log is optimized for handling write-heavy workloads while you can let other applications or services project events into read models optimized for reading like a cache. You can also use multiple read replicas and subscribers to handle a large number of events. |
| Scalable | Processes that you can efficiently handle as workloads increase without a significant drop in performance or needing a proportional increase in resources. For example, imagine you're running a global e-commerce retailer that needs to scale to meet peak holiday season traffic. | Applications that use events in EventStoreDB can be effectively decoupled from your other applications, allowing them to be more scalable. EventStoreDB supports read replicas to help you scale the number of reads it handles. |
| Measurable | Processes within your organization that you can track and evaluate, such as a manufacturing process where each step is measured to analyze and optimize for operational efficiency. | With EventStoreDB’s historical events, you can analyze past actions over time to identify opportunities for process optimization. By using streams, you can focus on specific criteria and retrieve events based on a particular group (such as manufacturing line #1), a specific date (like January 1st), or a status (such as in-progress or completed). |
