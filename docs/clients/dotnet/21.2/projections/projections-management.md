# Projections management

The EventStoreDB Client API includes helper methods that use the HTTP API to allow you to manage projections. This document describes the methods found in the `ProjectionsManager` class. All methods in this class are asynchronous.

## Enable a projection

Enables an existing projection by name. You must have access to a projection to enable it.

```csharp
public Task EnableAsync(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Disable a projection

Disables an existing projection by name. You must have access to a projection to disable it.

```csharp
public Task DisableAsync(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Abort a projection

Aborts an existing projection by name. You must have access to a projection to abort it.

```csharp
public Task AbortAsync(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Create a one-time projection

Creates a projection that runs until the end of the log and then stops. The query parameter contains the JavaScript you want created as a one time projection.

```csharp
public Task CreateOneTimeAsync(string query, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Create a continuous projection

Creates a projection that runs until the end of the log and then continues running. The query parameter contains the JavaScript you want created as a one time projection. Continuous projections have explicit names and you can enable or disable them via this name.

```csharp
public Task CreateContinuousAsync(string name, string query, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## List all projections

Returns a list of all projections.

```csharp
public Task<List<ProjectionDetails>> ListAllAsync(UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## List one-time projections

Returns a list of all One-Time Projections.

```csharp
public Task<List<ProjectionDetails>> ListOneTimeAsync(UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Get statistics on a projection

Returns the statistics associated with a named projection.

```csharp
public Task<string> GetStatisticsAsync(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Delete projection

Deletes a named projection. You must have access to a projection to delete it.

```csharp
public Task DeleteAsync(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Get state

Retrieves the state of a projection.

```csharp
public Task<string> GetState(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Get partition state

Retrieves the state of the projection via the given partition.

```csharp
public Task<string> GetPartitionStateAsync(string name, string partition, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Get result

Retrieves the result of the projection.

```csharp
public Task<string> GetResult(string name, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```

## Get partition result

Retrieves the result of the projection via the given partition.

```csharp
public Task<string> GetPartitionResultAsync(string name, string partition, UserCredentials userCredentials = null)
```
