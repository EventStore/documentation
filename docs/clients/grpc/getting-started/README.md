Get started by connecting your application to EventStoreDB. Complete the form below to generate the connection string and examples for different languages and SDKs.

## Connection details

This page can help you to generate the connection string for a single-node or cluster deployment of EventStoreDB. You can use one of the following methods:

- Use the [Event Store Cloud](https://eventstore.com/cloud) cluster ID.
- Use the address of any node of a self-hosted cluster or single-node deployment. You need to have access to the node for the discovery feature to work.
- Specify the deployment details manually.
