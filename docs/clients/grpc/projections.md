# Projection management

The various gRPC client APIs include dedicated clients that allow you to manage projections.

::: warning
Currently not all clients fully expose all operations.
:::

For a detailed explanation of projections, see the [server documentation](@server/projections.md).

You can find the full sample code from this documentation page in the respective [clients repositories](https://github.com/eventStore/?q=client).

## Required packages

Install the client SDK package to your project.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item C#
```bash
dotnet add package EventStore.Client.Grpc.ProjectionManagement --version 21.*
```
:::
::: code-group-item Go
```Go
// This is currently not available in the Go client
```
:::
::: code-group-item Java
```
# Maven

## Creating a client

Projection management operations are exposed through a dedicated client.

<xode-group>
<xode-block title="C#" code="connectionString">

@[code{createClient}](@grpc:projection-management/Program.cs)

</xode-block>
<xode-block title="Go" code="connectionString">

## Create a projection

Creates a projection that runs until the last event in the store, and then continues processing new events as they are appended to the store. The query parameter contains the JavaScript you want created as a projection.
Projections have explicit names, and you can enable or disable them via this name.

:::
::: code-group-item TypeScript
@[code{CreateContinuous}](@grpc:projection-management.ts)
:::

Trying to create projections with the same name will result in an error:

## Restart the subsystem
Restarts the entire projection subsystem. The user must be in the `$ops` or `$admin` group to perform this operation

@[code{RestartSubSystem}](@grpc:projection-management/Program.cs)

## Enable a projection

Enables an existing projection by name.
Once enabled, the projection will start to process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to enable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security.md#access-control-lists)

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item C#
@[code{Enable}](@grpc:projection-management/Program.cs)

## Disable a projection

Disables a projection, this will save the projection checkpoint.
Once disabled, the projection will not process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to disable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security.md#access-control-lists)

:::warning
The .net clients up to version 21.2 had an incorrect behavior: they _will not_ save the checkpoint

| `BufferedEvents`                     | The number of events in the projection read buffer                                                                                                                                                    |
| `WritePendingEventsBeforeCheckpoint` | The number of events waiting to be appended to emitted streams before the pending checkpoint can be written                                                                                           |
| `WritePendingEventsAfterCheckpoint`  | The number of events to be appended to emitted streams since the last checkpoint                                                                                                                      |
| `Version`                            | This is used internally, the version is increased when the projection is edited or reset                                                                                                              |
| `Epoch`                              | This is used internally, the epoch is increased when the projection is reset                                                                                                                          |

The `Status` string is a combination of the following values.
The first 3 are the most common one, as the other one are transient values while the projection is initialised or stopped

| Value              | Description                                                                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running            | The projection is running and processing events                                                                        |
| Stopped            | The projection is stopped and is no longer processing new events                                                       |
| Faulted            | An error occurred in the projection, `StateReason` will give the fault details, the projection is not processing events |
| Initial            | This is the initial state, before the projection is fully initialised                                                  |
| Suspended          | The projection is suspended and will not process events, this happens while stopping the projection                    |
| LoadStateRequested | The state of the projection is being retrieved, this happens while the projection is starting                          |
| StateLoaded        | The state of the projection is loaded, this happens while the projection is starting                                   |
| Subscribed         | The projection has successfully subscribed to its readers, this happens while the projection is starting               |
| FaultedStopping    | This happens before the projection is stopped due to an error in the projection                                        |
| Stopping           | The projection is being stopped                                                                                        |
| CompletingPhase    | This happens while the projection is stopping                                                                          |
| PhaseCompleted     | This happens while the projection is stopping                                                                          |
