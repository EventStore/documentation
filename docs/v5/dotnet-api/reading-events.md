# Reading events

You can use the client API to read events from a stream starting from either end of the stream. There is a method for each direction and one for reading a single event.

## Methods

<!-- TODO: Do the same apply here as in HTTP API -->

### Read a single event

```csharp
Task<EventReadResult> ReadEventAsync(string stream, long eventNumber, bool resolveLinkTos);
```

### Read a specific stream forwards

```csharp
Task<StreamEventsSlice> ReadStreamEventsForwardAsync(string stream, long start, int count, bool resolveLinkTos)
```

### Read a specific stream backwards

```csharp
Task<StreamEventsSlice> ReadStreamEventsBackwardAsync(string stream, long start, int count, bool resolveLinkTos)
```

### Read all events forwards

```csharp
Task<AllEventsSlice> ReadAllEventsForwardAsync(Position position, int maxCount, bool resolveLinkTos);
```

### Read all events backwards

```csharp
Task<AllEventsSlice> ReadAllEventsBackwardAsync(Position position, int maxCount, bool resolveLinkTos);
```

::: tip
These methods also have an optional parameter which allows you to specify the `UserCredentials` to use for the request. If you don't supply any, the default credentials for the `EventStoreConnection` are used ([see Connecting to a server - user credentials](/v5/dotnet-api/connecting-to-a-server.md#user-credentials)).

## StreamEventsSlice

The reading methods for individual streams each return a `StreamEventsSlice`, which is immutable. The available members on `StreamEventsSlice` are:

| Member                        | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string Stream`               | The name of the stream for the slice                                                                                                        |
| `ReadDirection ReadDirection` | Either `ReadDirection.Forward` or `ReadDirection.Backward` depending on which method was used to read                                       |
| `long FromEventNumber`        | The sequence number of the first event in the stream                                                                                        |
| `long LastEventNumber`        | The sequence number of the last event in the stream                                                                                         |
| `long NextEventNumber`        | The sequence number from which the next read should be performed to continue reading the stream                                             |
| `bool IsEndOfStream`          | Whether this slice contained the end of the stream at the time it was created                                                               |
| `ResolvedEvent[] Events`      | An array of the events read. See the description of how to interpret a [Resolved Events](/v5/dotnet-api/reading-events.md#resolvedevent) below for more information on this |

## ResolvedEvent

When you read events from a stream (or received over a subscription) you receive an instance of the `RecordedEvent` class packaged inside a `ResolvedEvent`.

Event Store supports a special event type called 'Link Events'. Think of these events as pointers to an event in another stream.

In situations where the event you read is a link event, `ResolvedEvent` allows you to access both the link event itself, as well as the event it points to.

The members of this class are as follows:

| Member                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RecordedEvent Event`         | The event, or the resolved link event if this `ResolvedEvent` is a link event                                                                                                     |
| `RecordedEvent Link`          | The link event if this `ResolvedEvent` is a link event                                                                                                                            |
| `RecordedEvent OriginalEvent` | Returns the event read or which triggered the subscription. If this `ResolvedEvent` represents a link event, the link will be the `OriginalEvent`, otherwise it will be the event |
| `bool IsResolved`             | Indicates whether this `ResolvedEvent` is a resolved link event                                                                                                                   |
| `Position? OriginalPosition`  | The logical position of the `OriginalEvent`                                                                                                                                       |
| `string OriginalStreamId`     | The stream name of the `OriginalEvent`                                                                                                                                            |
| `long OriginalEventNumber`    | The event number in the stream of the `OriginalEvent`                                                                                                                             |

::: tip
To ensure that the Event Store server follows link events when reading, ensure you set the `ResolveLinkTos` parameter to `true` when calling read methods.
:::

## RecordedEvent

`RecordedEvent` contains all the data about a specific event. Instances of this class are immutable, and expose the following members:

| Member                 | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string EventStreamId` | The Event Stream this event belongs to                                     |
| `Guid EventId`         | The Unique Identifier representing this event                              |
| `long EventNumber`     | The number of this event in the stream                                     |
| `string EventType`     | The event type (supplied when writing)                                     |
| `byte[] Data`          | A byte array representing the data of this event                           |
| `byte[] Metadata`      | A byte array representing the metadata associated with this event          |
| `bool IsJson`          | Indicates whether the content was internally marked as json                |
| `DateTime Created`     | A `datetime` representing when this event was created.                     |
| `long CreatedEpoch`    | A long representing the milliseconds since the epoch when the was created. |

## Read a single event

The `ReadEventAsync` method reads a single event from a stream at a specified position. This is the simplest case of reading events, but is still useful for situations such as reading the last event in the stream used as a starting point for a subscription. This function accepts three parameters:

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string stream`       | The stream to read from                                                                                                                                             |
| `long eventNumber`    | The event number to read (use `StreamPosition.End` to read the last event in the stream)                                                                            |
| `bool resolveLinkTos` | Determines whether any link events encountered in the stream will be resolved. See the discussion on [Resolved Events](/v5/dotnet-api/reading-events.md#resolvedevent) for more information on this |

This method returns an instance of `EventReadResult` which indicates if the read was successful, and if so the `ResolvedEvent` that was read.

## Reading a stream forwards

The `ReadStreamEventsForwardAsync` method reads the requested number of events in the order in which they were originally written to the stream from a nominated starting point in the stream.

The parameters are:

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string Stream`       | The name of the stream to read                                                                                                                                      |
| `long start`          | The earliest event to read (inclusive). For the special case of the start of the stream, you should use the constant `StreamPosition.Start`.                        |
| `int count`           | The maximum number of events to read in this request (assuming that many exist between the start specified and the end of the stream)                               |
| `bool resolveLinkTos` | Determines whether any link events encountered in the stream will be resolved. See the discussion on [Resolved Events](/v5/dotnet-api/reading-events.md#resolvedevent) for more information on this |

### Example: Read an entire stream forwards from start to end

This example uses the `ReadStreamEventsForwardAsync` method in a loop to page through all events in a stream, reading 200 events at a time to build a list of all the events in the stream.

```csharp
var streamEvents = new List<ResolvedEvent>();

StreamEventsSlice currentSlice;
long nextSliceStart = StreamPosition.Start;
do
{
    currentSlice =
    _eventStoreConnection.ReadStreamEventsForwardAsync("myStream", nextSliceStart,
                                                  200, false)
                                                  .Result;

    nextSliceStart = currentSlice.NextEventNumber;

    streamEvents.AddRange(currentSlice.Events);
} while (!currentSlice.IsEndOfStream);
```

::: tip
It's unlikely that client code would need to build a list in this manner. It's far more likely that you would pass events into a left fold to derive the state of some object as of a given event.
:::

## Read a stream backwards

The `ReadStreamEventsBackwardAsync` method reads the requested number of events in the reverse order from that in which they were originally written to the stream from a specified starting point.

The parameters are:

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string Stream`       | The name of the stream to read                                                                                                                                      |
| `long start`          | The latest event to read (inclusive). For the end of the stream use the constant `StreamPosition.End`                                                               |
| `int count`           | The maximum number of events to read in this request (assuming that many exist between the start specified and the start of the stream)                             |
| `bool resolveLinkTos` | Determines whether any link events encountered in the stream will be resolved. See the discussion on [Resolved Events](/v5/dotnet-api/reading-events.md#resolvedevent) for more information on this |

## Read all events

Event Store allows you to read events across all streams using the `ReadAllEventsForwardAsync` and `ReadAllEventsBackwardsAsync` methods. These work in the same way as the regular read methods, but use an instance of the global log file `Position` to reference events rather than the simple integer stream position described previously.

They also return an `AllEventsSlice` rather than a `StreamEventsSlice` which is the same except it uses global `Position`s rather than stream positions.

### Example: Read all events forward from start to end

```csharp
var allEvents = new List<ResolvedEvent>();

AllEventsSlice currentSlice;
var nextSliceStart = Position.Start;

do
{
    currentSlice =
        connection.ReadAllEventsForwardAsync(nextSliceStart, 200, false).Result;

    nextSliceStart = currentSlice.NextPosition;

    allEvents.AddRange(currentSlice.Events);
} while (!currentSlice.IsEndOfStream);
```
