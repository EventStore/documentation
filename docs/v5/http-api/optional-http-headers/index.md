# Optional HTTP headers

<!-- TODO: Can Swagger replace this? And sub files -->

Event Store supports custom HTTP headers for requests. The headers were previously in the form `X-ES-ExpectedVersion` but were changed to `ES-ExpectedVersion` in compliance with [RFC-6648](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648).

The headers supported are:

| Header                                   | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ES-ExpectedVersion](~/http-api/optional-http-headers/expected-version.md) | The expected version of the stream (allows optimistic concurrency)                                 |
