## Loan Application

To get you started, we've created an example application packaged as a set of Docker containers that illustrates the flow of events being appended to streams in KurrentDB.

After you have completed the following tutorial, you will have:

- Familiarized yourself with the Kurrent Cloud UI
- Connected an example application to Kurrent Cloud
- Navigated the KurrentDB Web UI and investigated events appended to streams
- Been provided with resources such as documentation, videos, e-learning, and sample code repositories, to take the next step in your Kurrent Cloud journey
