## Provisioning

Kurrent Cloud allows you to provision managed KurrentDB clusters in AWS (_more providers will be added soon_) using shared infrastructure. Note that each database cluster is isolated from other tenants, making them highly secure and cost effective.


### Public access

For public access, the provisioning process is straightforward. Visit the Clusters screen and click on the **New cluster** button. From there, select **Shared** as the infrastructure type. An IP Access List will be created and the cluster will be deployed.

See the [Public Access Clusters](public.md) guide for more details.

### Tutorials

Once you have a cluster up and running, feel free to review the [tutorial](../../tutorials.md) section.
