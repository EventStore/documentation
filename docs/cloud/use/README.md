# Connecting to the cloud

Each major cloud provider implements the concept of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). A VPC gives you as the cloud user an isolated private network, to which you attach cloud compute resources (virtual machines, container orchestrators, etc) or managed resources, like database servers. VPCs are always in private network address spaces and therefore not directly accessible from the outside of the VPC without additional configuration and infrastructure.

## Networking

Normally, organisations build internal practices in regards to VPCs isolation and access level. In particular, you would expect that some or all VPCs are available for direct access from local networks on-premises, for developers to be able to access cloud resources. Cloud providers let their customers to connect on-premises networks to VPCs using site-to-site VPN connections. In addition, cloud customers often set up virtual private gateways to allow point-to-site VPN connections for their remote users.

Event Store Cloud deploys EventStoreDB clusters on a project-level VPC (network). By peering that network with your own VPC at the same cloud provider, you get access to the EventStoreDB cluster provisioned and managed by Event Store Cloud. Normally, your Ops engineers would be able to configure the routing and allow connecting to EventStoreDB clusters in the cloud.

## TailScale

Another options to connect to the cloud cluster is to use a third-party VPN offering, which might be easier to use. One example would [TailScale](https://tailscale.com), which is a [WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) based mesh VPN. In addition to the basic functionality of connecting devices in a mesh network, TailGate also allows connecting a subnet to the private VPN. For that, you'd need to provision a VM in the cloud, which is connected to the network peered with Event Store Cloud network. Since that machine would be able to access the EventStoreDB cluster, by configuring the TailScale [subnet routing](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets) you will also make the cluster accessible for all users of your TailScale network.

Check our [Tailscale guide](tailscale.md) for detailed instructions.

## Cluster connection

Event Store Cloud unconditionally provisions secure EventStoreDB clusters with both TLS for TCP and SSL for HTTP and gRPC enabled. This configuration cannot be changed.

Cloud clusters use SSL certificates signed by the trusted public certificate authority and therefore you won't need to do any additional work that is usually associated with self-signed certificates.

After you provision the cloud cluster, you can find connection details for the cluster in the Cloud console.

In the cluster details you can find URIs for the EventStoreDB Admin UI and HTTP API, TCP client and gRPC client.

The DNS name of the cluster resolves to IP addresses of all the cluster nodes or to the IP address of a single instance, depending on the deployment topology. When connecting to a multi-node cluster, you'd need to use the seed-based gossip with all the cluster nodes when using 20.6. 

For 20.6+ gRPC clients, we advise to use the [gRPC connection generator](https://developers.eventstore.com/clients/grpc/getting-started/) page in the documentation where you can use your cloud cluster ID to get a properly composed connection string.

Each cluster node has its own DNS name, which can be used for accessing individual nodes for node-specific operations like stats collection or scavenging.
