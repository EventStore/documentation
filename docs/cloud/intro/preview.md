# Cloud Preview

EventStoreDB Cloud is currently in Preview. On this page we describe what Preview means exactly.

## Why Preview?

At this stage, EventStoreDB Cloud uses the latest available production release of EventStoreDB. It is important to understand that as part of the Preview our customers use the **production** version of our underlying database product.

The Preview stage only applies to the managed cloud. We consider it production-ready, but it lacks some important features, which we believe are necessary for the generally available (GA) product.

In order to ensure the best customer experience for early adopters of EventStoreDB Cloud, the Preview phase is enabled for everyone but new customers cannot provision paid cloud resources right after creating the account. You, however, can see what cloud providers we support, available instance sizes and prices. When you decide to move on and provision one or more clusters, request us to enable provisioning for you in the Cloud console.
