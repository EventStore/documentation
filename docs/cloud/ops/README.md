# Event Store Cloud Jobs

The Event Store Cloud runs scheduled jobs on the user's behalf. All of these jobs consist of a human readable description and a schedule.

Currently the following jobs are supported: 
* [Scheduled backups](./scheduled_backups.md)

## Job Schedules

The schedule format used by the Event Store Cloud CLI tool and API is a simplified subset of [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview), in the future we may support more cron features.

The supported subset is:

* for the first field, minute:
    * a wildcard `*`
    * a number between `0` and `59` (inclusive). 
    * a rate, written as a wildcard divided by a number. E.g:  `*/15`
* For the second field, hour:
    * a wildcard `*`
    * a number must be between `0` and `23` (inclusive)
    * a rate, written as a wildcard divided by a number. E.g:  `*/1`
* for the third field, day of month: 
    * a wildcard `*`
* for the fourth field, month: 
    * a wildcard `*`
* for the fifth field, day of the week: 
    * a wildcard `*`
    * a number between `0` and `7` (inclusive), Sunday to Saturday

```
 ┌───────────── Minute: wildcard, number (0 - 59), rate
 │ ┌─────────── Hour: wildcard, number (0 - 23), rate
 │ │ ┌───────── Day of the month: wildcard
 │ │ │ ┌─────── Month: wildcard
 │ │ │ │ ┌───── Day of the week: wildcard, number (0 - 7)

::: note
Scheduled backups have a minimum frequency of 60 minutes.
Currently it is not possible to schedule backups more frequently.

### Examples:

`0 */1 * * *` runs a job once an hour, at minute 00. 

`0 12 * * 1` runs a job at 12:00 PM on Monday.

`30 13 * * 0` runs a job at 13:30 PM on Sunday.
