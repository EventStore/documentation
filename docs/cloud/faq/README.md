# Availability

### Is there any type of alerting functionality for cluster issues?

Yes. Learn more in the [Events Console](../intro/quick-start.md#events-and-notifications) documentation section.

### Does the admin UI run on the provisioned cluster?

Yes. Go to the clusters list in the Cloud Console, select the cluster you need and click on the `Addresses` tab on the bottom panel. You will find the admin UI URL there. You need to be connected to a network, which is routed to Event Store Cloud to open the admin UI in your browser.

### How do you handle infrastructure related issues, which cause unavailability or degradation of service?

Event Store Cloud site reliability engineering (SRE) team manages cluster availability.
