# Support 

### For same day response, what time zone is your 9am-5pm response against?

Our support response time windows are provided in GMT time zone.

### What level of access does the customer have to resolve minor incidents?

Customers do not have direct access to VMs, where the database cluster nodes are running. A lot of management functions are available via the HTTP API, which is available for customers to access and use.

You can also use our cloud automation tools ([Terraform](../automation/terraform.md) provider and CLI) to manage your cloud resources.
