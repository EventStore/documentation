# Support 

### For same day response, what time zone is your 9am-5pm response against?

Our support response time windows are provided in GMT time zone.

### What level of access does the customer have to resolve minor incidents?

Customers do not have direct access to VMs, where the database cluster nodes are running. A lot of management functions are available via the HTTP API, which is available for customers to access and use.

You can also use our cloud automation tools ([Terraform](../automation/terraform.md) provider and CLI) to manage your cloud resources.

### If a node goes down in a cluster, how is the cluster recovered and who does it?

If the issue is cloud provider related, our staff manages the replacement.  

If it is customer load related, an issue will be created with a call to action for the customer to address.
