# EventStoreDB documentation

EventStoreDB is the open-source, functional database with Complex Event Processing in Javascript.

This repository contains documentation for both server and client SDK.

## Local development

Documentation is written using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

### Prerequisites

1. `NodeJS` installed (see [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download//)).
2. `Yarn` installed (see [installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)).

### Running docs locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn docs:dev`

### Running production build

To run the production build that will import documentation from database and client repositories run:

```bash
yarn docs:build-prod
```

To import documentation from external repositories:

```bash
yarn docs:import
```

To build documentation without importing documentation:

```bash
yarn docs:build
```

### Algolia Search

Documentation is using Algolia for indexing and searching through the contents.

To run Algolia search locally, create [.algolia/.env](.algolia/.env) file filled with contents based on the Algolia configuration:

```bash
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=
ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY=
ALGOLIA_SITE_URL=
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=
```

_**Note:** Make sure that you saved it with LF eol characters._

### Scraping data locally

The scraping script uses a Docker, so you need to have Docker installed and running before running it.

Go to the [.algolia](.algolia) folder and run the [scrape.sh](.algolia/scrape.sh) script. 

*Note: On windows we recommend to run the script in [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).*

### Adding new programming language snippets

To add new language snippet it's needed to add import of [Prism.JS](https://prismjs.com/) plugin to [VuePress plugins config](docs/.vuepress/enhanceApp.js), e.g.:

```javascript
import "prismjs/components/prism-java";
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows

1. `EPERM: operation not permitted` during `yarn install` - this error may appear if you've run the `yarn install` from Windows before running it on the WSL2. See troubleshooting [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58414196).
2. If `yarn docs:dev` fails, verify if your path does not contain spaces. We noticed some issues related to that.

#### Ubuntu

1. `ERROR: There are no scenarios; must have at least one.` while running `yarn` commands. Ubuntu has preinstalled `cmdtest` package that registers conflicting `yarn`. You might need to uninstall it and then configure yarn again. See troubleshooting [link](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821#issuecomment-284181365)

#### Error: Cannot find module '../../server/generated/v21.2/docs/sidebar.js'

run `yarn predocs:build`
